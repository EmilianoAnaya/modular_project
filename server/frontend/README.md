# Setting up the Frontend (Dev)
***
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before executing any of the forward commands, be sure to be in the frontend folder of the project. Making sure this is the right path on your terminal:
>
> **<p style="text-align : center; font-size:2em">/modular_project/server/frontend</p>**
>
> Once in the correct path, you may continue

## Installing the dependencies

To install the dependencies of React + Vite, you only have to execute this command on the folder:

```
    npm install 
```

Installing all the dependecies from the package.json file.

## How to run the Frontend

One all the dependencies are started, make sure to run it by using the following command:
```
    npm run dev
```
This will allow you to use hot reload, helping with the constant changes you do to the files for the frontend, updating the views automatically on running time once you save a file you are currently working with.
